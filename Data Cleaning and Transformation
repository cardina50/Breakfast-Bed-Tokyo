### **Microsoft Excel** 

-  I started by creating copies of the datasets I downloaded.
- Found and deleted duplicate values


-  ![Duplicate values](https://github.com/cardina50/Breakfast-Bed-Tokyo/assets/130823144/09d57594-729f-46d1-b4fd-9d8dc7fb2d7b)

- Listing with zero price found and deleted.

- ![Listing with 0 price](https://github.com/cardina50/Breakfast-Bed-Tokyo/assets/130823144/a90dc246-5753-4f20-808a-6ccffeff5a23)

- Deleted the License, neighbourhood_group, name,  last_review, reviews_per_month, number_of_reviews_itm columns

- Changed the data format of id, host_id, and neighborhood from General to Text, I also changed the price column, from general to currency, specifically Japanese Yen.

-  Deleted host_name column, because a lot of names in the column appeared in special characters and were ineligible.

- ![Delete host_name](https://github.com/cardina50/Breakfast-Bed-Tokyo/assets/130823144/64daf629-884e-4407-a31c-1176c38672c2)

- 1252 records with zero reviews found and deleted.

- Used Vlookup function to extract Maximum nights from the Calendar Spreadsheet. 
 =VLOOKUP(A2, calendar.csv!$A:$G, 7,FALSE)

-  Found 8302 listings where Vlookup couldnâ€™t find the maximum nights from the calendar spreadsheet, so I used an error handler, IFERROR Formula to substitute #N/A with 0.
-  =IFERROR(VLOOKUP(A2, calendar.csv!$A:$G, 7,FALSE), 0) and deleted them.


### **Tableau**

- Created a calculated field named "Category" using the IF statement to classify listings based on their prices.
